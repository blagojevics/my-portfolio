### **Portfolio Design Blueprint (Conceptual Figma File)**

#### **1. Color Palette**

- **Primary Background:** `#121212` (Dark Black)
- **Text Color:** `#e0e0e0` (Off-white)
- **Accent Color:** `#00aaff` (Vibrant Sky Blue)

#### **2. Typography**

- **Headings (h1, h2, etc.):** A modern sans-serif font like `Poppins` or `Montserrat` (Bold weight).
- **Body Text (p, a):** A highly readable sans-serif font like `Roboto` or `Inter` (Regular weight).

#### **3. High-Level Layout**

- **Structure:** A single, vertically-scrolling page with clear, defined sections.
- **Spacing:** Use generous padding (`p-16`) and margins (`mb-10`) to give the sections plenty of white space.

#### **4. Section Breakdowns**

- **Hero Section:** A simple, centered section with your name, title, and a one-sentence tagline. The goal is to make a strong first impression.
- **Projects Section:** A responsive grid that displays your projects. Each project card should have a clear image, the project title, and a brief description. The links to the live site and GitHub should be prominent.
- **Skills Section:** A simple, horizontal row of "pills" or "badges" that list your skills. Use the accent color to highlight them.
- **Contact Section:** A simple footer with your email, GitHub, and LinkedIn links.
